## deep learning and speech recognition 
###Microsoft

http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/deng/  
Li Deng (IEEE M'89;SM'92;F'04) received the Ph.D. degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He was an assistant professor (1989-1992), tenured associate professor (1992-1996), and tenured Full Professor (1996-1999) at the University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. In 1999, he joined Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA, where he is currently Principal Researcher and Research Manager of the Deep Learning Technology Center. Since 2000, he has also been an Affiliate Full Professor and graduate committee member at the University of Washington, Seattle, teaching graduate course of Computer Speech Processing and serving on Ph.D. thesis committees. Prior to joining Microsoft, he also worked or/and taught at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, ATR Interpreting Telecom. Research Lab. (Kyoto, Japan), and HKUST. He has been granted over 60 US or international patents in acoustics/audio, speech/language technology, and machine learning. He received numerous awards/honors bestowed by IEEE, ISCA, ASA, Microsoft, and other organizations.

### Google

http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/
Geoffrey Everest Hinton FRS (born 6 December 1947) is a British-born computer scientist and psychologist, most noted for his work on artificial neural networks. He is now partly working for Google.[1] He is the co-inventor of the backpropagation and contrastive divergence training algorithms and is an important figure in the deep learning movement.

Vincent Vanhoucke is a Research Scientist at Google. He is a technical lead and manager in Google's deep learning infrastructure team. Prior to that, he lead the speech recognition quality effort for Google Search by Voice. He holds a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University and a Diplôme d'Ingénieur from the Ecole Centrale Paris.

###  conferences
Popular speech recognition conferences held each year or two include SpeechTEK and SpeechTEK Europe, ICASSP, Interspeech/Eurospeech, and the IEEE ASRU. Conferences in the field of natural language processing, such as ACL, NAACL, EMNLP, and HLT, are beginning to include papers on speech processing. Important journals include the IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing (now named IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing), Computer Speech and Language, and Speech Communication.

## discussion
<b> @血色又残阳 问：需要语音处理的资料?  要求 
1、论文最好有配套代码，可以跑；
2、当前学术界和工业界最新或者主流技术有哪些；
3、是否有跟深度学习结合的；
4、最好也有说话人鉴别的相关论文和代码。
